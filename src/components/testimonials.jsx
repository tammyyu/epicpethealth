                            <p>“Eduardo has been thrown off his schedule a bit lately.We have been using Calm at bedtime to help get ready for bed.He gets super sleepy, super quick.He also seems to be more restful all night long-  not getting up and moving around.At first he was wary of this “stuff”  I was putting on him, now as soon as he sees the bottle he comes and licks it right out of the dropper.”</p>

                            <p> “So Kylei started adding drops to his food and over time she can see a difference.For one thing she notices he isn’t as snappy with the kids, and just seems lots more CALM, and he is up and running around now like a youngster that he was before the DRUG REACTION.I sent Amy an email recently to tell her how well Bear is doing and we also talked about Stella’s eyes and how concerned I am about it going into something very serious.She generously is sending us her EYE’S to try to help with her dry eye issue.Stella has NO tears at all so she often has muscus forming in her eyes and she has a brown pigment all over her big eyes.This contributes to her blindness.So we are thanking AMY at EPIC PET HEALTH for being so helpful to Bear and Stella.We wish everyone who invested in pet health were as kind and thoughtful as she is.We will be letting you guys know how it works with Stella’s eyes.”</p>

                            <p>“When Simon, my 12yo cattle dog mix, is separated from me while I feed my other dogs, he becomes anxious and begins to bark loudly, sharply and continuously until I return.I believe that only increases his anxiety.He would even lose interest in his filled KONG or bone I gave him to keep him occupied.After only 3 days of using “Calm, ” I noticed a significant drop in the volume and amount of Simon’s barking, and an increase in length of time he was busy with his KONG or bone.I highly recommend “Calm” as part of your multifaceted approach to chronic anxiety in your dog!”</p>

                            <p>“I wanted to let you know that I ordered this second bottle of Happy for my dog, Molly because I am seeing some definite improvement in her anxiety.She is extremely sound sensitive, and has extreme reactions to noise.This makes it hard, especially on walks because I can’t anticipate and ensure there won’t be a sudden noise that will startle her, and cause the panic and disassociation.I found l-theanine back in April, and that has helped.Some things I have noticed since starting Happy  – 1) She has always run and hid when the baby gate is rattled and she no longer does that, 2) sometimes I have birds fly into my picture window, which would cause her to hide in the bathtub, and the two times this has happened since starting Happy, she has instead gone to the window and checked it out, 3) when out on walks, when she has heard startling noises, she still reacts, but does not start the wild eyed panic coupled with wanting to lunge and run back home or to the car.I am able to ‘reach her’ and help her settle back in and walk more calmly, and 4) I feel she has less of the general free floating anxiety that she has been most of her life.Thank you!</p>

                            <p>“I recently learned about Epic Pet Health and it was difficult for me to decide which product to order first.I went with Relief, because two of our dogs have arthritis.I spray Relief in their water and directly on the area that bothers them, rubbing it into their skin.I’ve noticed a difference in our dogs’ gait and I’m happy to be able to provide them something to alleviate the pain without pumping them full of pain killers.


                                If place an order, I’d suggest ordering several bottles of Relief or several items from the Epic Pet Health store, because 2-day shipping is spendy and as an impatient dog parent, I wanted the product as quickly as possible.Make the shipping worth it by ordering other products – Epic Pet Health offers several that are amazing.Calm, to keep our dogs calm when we leave for the day, Skin, to relieve irritated skin issues, and Repair for minor injuries.


                                We still visit our veterinarian for check ups, but it’s nice to have an option that’s less chemical and more natural.I’ll definitely be ordering more products from Epic Pet Health.”</p>

                                Before using Repair, Scarlett, almost 16 years old, was having difficulty getting up from a sitting position and also getting up when she had been lying down for even a short time.Scarlett was also having problems jumping up on her favorite couch and any elevated area.Within 24 hours of spraying Repair on Scarlett’s legs and adding it to her drinking water, she was getting up with ease from a sitting or lying position and also jumping up on the couch without difficulty or hesitation.Repair has made a tremendous difference in Scarlett’s quality of life.I plan to continue to use Repair as part of Scarlett’s health and maintenance plan to support her continued good health.Scarlett is definitely a more playful and much happier cat thanks to Repair.”</p>
