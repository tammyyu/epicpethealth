# epic-pet-health
Our client is the owner of a small at-home business, Epic Pet Health. Our client sells  "natural dog and cat supplements that restore comfort and provide affordable, long term health maintenance.” We will be re-designing the website by using bootstrap and MDL components. The shopping cart will direct to the company’s Shopify website. We will build the website using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

A couple of functions that may not be apprart to you...
1) The Contact Us Form, upon submissions, sends a form to the site owner's inbox - this works. 
2) The "Sign up for Newsletter" located in the footers allows users to subscribe to the newsletter by simply entering their email address. The entered email is automatically stored in FireBase - we removed authentication for better UX.
